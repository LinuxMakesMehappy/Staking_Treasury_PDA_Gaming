# Overview

## Concept
A simple treasury that stakes stablecoins in Jupiter's Earn protocol and distributes rewards proportionally to participants. No complex scaling or wage guarantees - just honest supplemental gaming rewards with market yields.

## Goals
- Provide realistic supplemental income (~$25/month) for dedicated players.
- Grow treasury sustainably through compounding at market rates (~3% APR).
- Maintain transparency with simple proportional distribution.
- Prioritize safety through conservative stablecoin staking.

## Flow
1. Participants deposit stablecoins into treasury.
2. Treasury stakes in Jupiter's Earn for market yields.
3. Weekly harvest of rewards to distribution vault.
4. Proportional distribution to participants; 70% surplus compounds.

## Safety measures
- Emergency withdrawal option for participants if needed.
- Conservative stablecoin selection (USDC, USDT) to minimize depeg risk.
- Transparent public dashboard showing treasury status and yields.
- Multisig governance for parameter changes.
- Regular audits and monitoring of Jupiter Earn protocol.

## Eligibility
- Stake a specified token OR hold a verified NFT collection.
- Active set determined by TVL milestones, optional cap, and epoch rotation.
