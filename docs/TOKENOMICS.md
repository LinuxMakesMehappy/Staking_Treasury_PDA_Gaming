# Tokenomics

## Simple Variables
- C: treasury capital (stablecoins)
- r: market yield rate (~3% APR)
- y: daily rewards = C × r ÷ 365
- n: number of participants
- d: daily payout per participant = y ÷ n

## Simple Distribution
- Weekly payouts proportional to participation
- No caps or artificial limits on participants
- 70% of rewards compound back into treasury
- 30% distributed as participant rewards

## Realistic Risks
- **Yield volatility**: Market rates fluctuate (2-4% APR typical range)
- **Platform risk**: Jupiter Earn could change terms or have outages
- **Stablecoin risk**: USDC/USDT depeg possible but historically rare
- **Smart contract risk**: Audits required, emergency withdrawals available
